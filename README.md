# Brain Tumor Classification â€“ Training Optimization  

## Overview  
This project optimizes the training process for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. The goal is to enhance model performance through advanced techniques such as data augmentation, class balancing, and transfer learning. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the impact of each training component.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- **Deep Learning** (CNNs, Transfer Learning)  
- **Data Processing** (Augmentation, Class Balancing)  
- **Evaluation** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy)  

## Key Features  
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation** (e.g., k=5) for robust performance estimation  
- **Performance Metrics Analysis** (mean & standard deviation across folds)  
- **Visualization** of training/validation loss & accuracy trends  
- **Ablation Study** to assess the impact of different training techniques  

## Results & Reporting  
- Model performance is evaluated on an independent test set.  
- Aggregated metrics are documented for comparison.  
- Findings provide insights into model stability and generalization.  

## Setup & Usage  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow torch numpy pandas matplotlib
   ```
